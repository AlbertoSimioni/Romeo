<h2>2D</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Identifies images type not time-dependent having two dimensions which correspond
to x-axis and to y-axis.</p>

<h2>2D-t (with time)</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Identifies time-dependent images type having two dimensions
which correspond to x-axis and to y-axis. The third dimension is time.</p>

<h2>3D</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Identifies images type not time-dependent having three dimensions which corre-
spond to x-axis, to y-axis and to z-axis.</p>

<h2>3D-t (with time)</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Identifies time-dependent images type having three dimensions
which correspond to x-axis, to y-axis and z-axis. The fourth dimension is time.</p>

<h2>Analyze</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>In the field of biomedical imaging, this term indicates a file format used
for storing MRI data. It consists of two files: the actual image file (.img) and its
header (.hdr).</p>

<h2>Clustering</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Technique that groups a set of objects in such a way that objects in the
same group (called cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each
other than to those in other groups (clusters).</p>

<h2>Clustering algorithm</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Function that applies a clustering technique to data that can
be original images or extracted features.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Identifies biomedical image to be analyzed.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Archive of Data. It is organized in subjects, each one with one image to
analysed. For each dataset one or more protocols can be associated.</p>

<h2>Feature</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Information extracted from the image, not present originally.</p>

<h2>Feature extractor</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Function that calculates a feature of interest from the data.</p>

<h2>GUI (Graphical User Interface)</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Set of elements and structures that allows the user to interact with the machine by manipulating conventional graphic objects.</p>

<h2>Library</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>In computer science, a library is a collection of implementations of behaviors,
written in terms of a language, that has a well-defined interface by which the
behavior is invoked. This means that as long as a higher level program uses a
library to make system calls, it does not need to be re-written to implement those
system calls over and over again. In addition, the behavior is provided for reuse by
multiple independent programs. A program invokes the library-provided behavior
via a mechanism of the language.</p>

<h2>Mask</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>A binary image, with same format of data, which is used to limit the analysis
to the image elements of interest (the data elements whose corresponding mask
values are zero are discarded from the analysis).</p>

<h2>NIfTI</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>NIfTI is a new Analyze-style data format, proposed by the NIfTI Data Format
Working Group as a short-term measure to facilitate inter-operation of functional
MRI data analysis software packages.</p>

<h2>Official protocol</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Identifies a definitive protocol.</p>

<h2>Protocol</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Set of one or more feature extractors and/or one clustering algorithm.
When a protocol is applied to a dataset, its execution must involve all selected
subjects. Executionâ€™s results are stored in a folder of file systems.</p>

<h2>Shared library</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Library that is loaded by program when it starts. When a shared library is installed properly, all programs that start afterwards automatically use the new shared library.</p>

<h2>Subject</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>A single instance of the dataset, to whom the data belongs to.</p>

<h2>Test protocol</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>Identifies a not definitive protocol used to verify that results produced
by its application are those expected. A test protocol can be transformed into an
official one.</p>
