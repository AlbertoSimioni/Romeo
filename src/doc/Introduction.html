<h2>1.1. Welcome to ROMEO</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>The software ROMEO, the Medical Imaging Cluster Analysis Tool, allows users to perform the features extraction and the cluster analysis of biomedical images. The program can show results of the analysis execution in real-time and can save them in a folder chosen by the user. The main characteristics of this product are simplicity and flexibility, in fact users must be able to insert through the GUI new features and algorithms defined by them.</p> 

<p>This program is built as a stand-alone application that works in complete independence from other programs. In order to work with ROMEO, user must have a computer running one of the following operating systems: <span class="italico">Windows 7</span> (Service Pack 1), <span class="italico">Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</span>, <span class="italico">Mac OS X 10.7 Lion</span> (both 32-bit and 64-bit versions).</p>

<div id="mainchar">
<h2>1.2. Main characteristics</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>The main characteristics that distinguish ROMEO are: <br> 
- Possibility to process two-dimensional and three-dimensional biomedical images and videos. <br>
- Support for many different image/video formats, including <span class="italico">Analyze</span> and <span class="italico">NIfTI</span>. <br>
- Intuitive and easy to use graphical user interface. <br>
- Possibility to extend the software by adding new features extractor and new clustering algorithms.
</p>

<div id="realization">
<h2>1.3. Realization</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>ROMEO has been realized in C++, a programming language famous for its intrinsic speed due to absence of any virtual machine or garbage collector. It also uses <span class="italico">ITK</span> and <span class="italico">VTK</span> libraries: these ones provide image manipulation with very efficient constructs. For the graphic it has been used <span class="italico">Qt</span>, that is the most famous C++ framework for the definition of user interface. The software has been largely tested through advanced software engineering tools, like <span class="italico">CCCC</span>, <span class="italico">CppCheck</span> and <span class="italico">QTest</span>: this grants robustness to the final product and the reliability of its results.</p>
</div>

<div id="developers">
<h2>1.4. Developers</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>The developer team of ROMEO is <span class="italico">Hurry Up!</span> composed by seven students of software engineering class of university of Padua: Alberto Cavallarin, Alberto Simioni, Alessandro Strenghetto, Andrea Ballista Flandoli, Federico Ziliotto, Matteo Pozza and Veronica Simioni.</p>

<p>The project was commissioned by four researchers of information engineering department of the same institute: Enea Poletti, Gaia Rizzo and Mattia Veronese.</p>

<p>The software was developed under the supervision of: Tullio Vardanega, associated and confirmed professor of university of Padua, and Riccardo Cardin, software engineering professor and strict collaborator of university of Padua</p>
