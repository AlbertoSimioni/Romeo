<div id="selectAnalysis">
<h2>5.1. Selective analysis</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>When you display the contents of a dataset, you will find the classic list of subjects content in the dataset: if you have to compute an analysis, the default behaviour is to execute the protocol on all the subject into the dataset.<br> <br>
Suppose to have inserted in a big dataset a wrong image for a subject and you have already executed all the analysis: you would like to re-execute the analysis only for the wrong subject, after having substituted his image. <br> <br>
Every subject in the list has a <span class="italico">checkbox</span> to the left that allows you to select only the subjects of interest for your analysis: in this way you can drastically reduce the time involved in analysis.<br><br></p>

<div id="drag&drop">
<h2>5.2. Drag & Drop functionalities</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>When inserting a new subject or when associating a protocol to a dataset, you use the buttons provided by the program: in the long run you can find frustrating this procedure. You can increase your speed by using the <span class="italico">drag & drop</span> functionalities provided by ROMEO. <br><br> 
If you want to add a subject to a dataset, you can quickly drag your image to analyze from the filesystem's panel at the left of the main window to the list of subjects already present, in order to add it to the dataset. Moreover you can select the image to analyze and, keeping pressed CTRL button, select also the corresponding mask image: drag them to the list of subjects of the dataset to add the new subject with its mask.<br><br>
In the same way you can associate a protocol to your dataset: just drag your interested protocol from the bottom left panel <span class="italico">Protocols List</span> to the top right panel <span class="italico">Protocols</span>. Doing this you will automatically associate the selected protocol to the current dataset.<br><br></p>

<div id="sharedLib">
<h2>5.3. One-for-all shared library</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<img style="float:right;" src=":/Images/Images/sharedLibrary.png">
<p>If you want to extend ROMEO with your feature extractors or your clustering algorithms, you can produce only one .h and .cpp files for all the functions you want to add. In this way you will produce only one shared library that will be referred many times from ROMEO.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

<div id="persMain">
<h2>5.4. Main window's personalization</h2>
<img src=":/Images/Images/BottomBorder.png">
<p>You can personalize the main window of ROMEO just dragging the splitters of the panels in the way you prefer: doing so you can hide undesired panels or expand panels with many items listed. <br><br>
An example can be a hypothetical image folder: once selected, you can hide the folder view in order to obtain a full view of the contents of the image folder.<br><br></p>
